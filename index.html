        <p>By joining a club and surrounding yourself
         with experienced, enthusiastic people instead of 
         depending solely on your own motivation, you’re more
          likely to run long-term. Seeing what others who started off 
          just like you have achieved, will inspire you to keep on 
          training. </p>
